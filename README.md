# Redux (Udemy Stephen Grider)

**Redux** is the data contained in the application 
**React** is the views contained in the application 

**Difference with other libraries like Angular, Backbone and Flux ** 
Redux: centralized data in a single object referred to as the **state** (application level state containing all the data of the application)
Other libraries has several collections. e.g. Backbone has collections and Flux has different stores.
